# HTTP-proxy
Created a proxy that uses TCP sockets and intercepts all HTTP requests and responses between a browser and web server. The proxy redirects each GET request for a JPG image to one of two file paths containing a PNG image. Additionally, the proxy replaces a keyword within the HTML message of a web server response with another word. The proxy was developed with C/C++ on Linux.
